# Python SDK for Zitadel

This is the Zitadel Python SDK, designed to provide a convenient and idiomatic
way to interact with the Zitadel APIs in Python. The SDK provides a seamless
wrapping of the Zitadel API, making it easy to authenticate service users and
perform API operations.

The SDK enables efficient integration with the Zitadel API, allowing you to
manage resources and execute actions. However, it's important to note that
this SDK is tailored for service users and is not intended for user
authentication scenarios. It does not support authentication mechanisms
like OAuth2, OIDC, or SAML for client applications, including web, mobile,
or other environments. For these types of user authentication, you should
use other libraries that are designed for the specific platform and
authentication method.

**Disclaimer**: This SDK is not suitable for implementing user authentication.
It does not handle authentication for client applications using OAuth2, OIDC,
or SAML and should not be used for scenarios requiring such functionality.
For those use cases, consider using other solutions that are designed for
user authentication across various platforms like web, mobile, or other
client environments.

## Getting Started

### Sign up for Zitadel
To use this SDK, you need a Zitadel account. Sign up at the official
Zitadel website and obtain the necessary credentials to access the API.

### Minimum Requirements
Ensure you have Python 3 or higher installed. You also need Poetry to
install dependencies.

## Using the SDK

### Installation
Install the SDK by running one of the following commands:

```bash
composer require zitadel/client
```

### Authentication

The SDK supports three authentication methods:

1. Private Key JWT Authentication
2. Client Credentials Grant
3. Personal Access Tokens (PATs)

For most service user scenarios in Zitadel, private key JWT authentication
is the recommended choice due to its benefits in security, performance, and control.
However, client credentials authentication might be considered in specific
situations where simplicity and trust between servers are priorities.

For more details on these authentication methods, please refer
to the [Zitadel documentation on authenticating service users](https://zitadel.com/docs/guides/integrate/service-users/authenticate-service-users).


### Example

```python
import zitadel_client as zitadel

with zitadel.Zitadel("your-zitadel-base-url", 'your-valid-token') as client:
	try:
		response = client.users.add_human_user(
			body=zitadel.V2AddHumanUserRequest(
				username="john.doe",
				profile=zitadel.V2SetHumanProfile(given_name="John", family_name="Doe"),
				email=zitadel.V2SetHumanEmail(email="johndoe@doe.com")
			)
		)
		print("User created:", response)
	except Exception as e:
		raise e
```

### Debugging
The SDK supports debug logging, which can be enabled for troubleshooting
and debugging purposes. You can enable debug logging by setting the `debug`
flag to `true` when initializing the `Zitadel` client, like this:

```python
zitadel = zitadel.Zitadel("your-zitadel-base-url", 'your-valid-token', lambda config: config.debug = True)
```

When enabled, the SDK will log additional information, such as HTTP request
and response details, which can be useful for identifying issues in the
integration or troubleshooting unexpected behavior.

## Design and Dependencies

This SDK is designed to be lean and efficient, focusing on providing a
streamlined way to interact with the Zitadel API. It relies on the commonly used
urllib3 HTTP transport for making requests, which ensures that
the SDK integrates well with other libraries and provides flexibility
in terms of request handling and error management.

This SDK follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). You can refer to
the releases for details on the changes between versions.
